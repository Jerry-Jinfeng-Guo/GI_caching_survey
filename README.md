# A Survey of Caching Techniques in Global Illumination
This is my survey on various caching techniques used in realistic image synthesis with Global Illumination. Since my personal page as a master student in Utrecht University will be out-of-reach in any minute, for the time being I archive this thing here at Github.

The survey starts with rendering basics and then, in each chapter, discusses (ir)radiance caching, photon mapping, visibility caching and importance caching that were state-of-the-art at the time of writing. Hopefully this survey can provide any help or reference to certain degree for people interested.

Happy rendering!
